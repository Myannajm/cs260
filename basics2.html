	    <h2>A Year in Review</h2>
	    <em><p> Each of these albums has personal significance to different eras I went through in the year 2021. As you can see, I truly have curated a very eclectic grouping of music within this year, each complete with it's own accompanying mosaic of memories. This music represents finding myself again after not knowing who I was for far too long.</p></em>
